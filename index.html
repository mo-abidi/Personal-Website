            <p class="project-subtitle">Respiratory Simulation System for the OrganOx <i>metra</i></p>
            <p>With OrganOx, I gained experience in biomedical Engineering. OrganOx produces the <i>metra</i>, which is
              a normothermic perfusion device. The <i>metra</i> allows human livers to be kept alive outside of the body by simulating a human vascular system
              and  circulating blood through the isolated liver. The circulating blood is constantly sampled for biological markers and metrics including oxygen and glucose levels,
              which are automatically adjusted to remain at desired levels. Normothermic perfusion is an important and rapidly growing field in transplant medicine, as it allows for damaged
              livers to be repaired before transplantation, resulting in higher success rates for the transplantation.</p>
            <p>I was tasked with improving the <i>metra</i>'s simulation of the human body. Like all organs, the liver experiences motion when a person breathes, which promotes blood flow through the organ.
               To simulate this, I designed a customized electropneumatic system and coded firmware which allowed for dynamic perfusion to be performed. After building the system, 
               I lab-tested it with a porcine liver. This resulted in a significant reduction in cell death, which is common on the peripheries of the liver during static perfusion. 
              Due to the success of the design, this system will be incorporated in future versions of the <i>metra</i>, ensuring greater transplant success rates.</p>

            <p>The culmination of my Mechanical Engineering degree was Capstone, a fourth-year design project. With a team of three other Engineers, I worked in 
              collaboration with Christie Digital Systems, a leading manufacturer of display technology. We were asked to design a novel LCD panel array mounting system,
              which Christie was previously outsourcing. Over the course of two terms, we successfully designed, verified, prototyped, and tested our solution. We presented our 
              finalized design at the Mechanical Engineering Symposium, resulting in a project grade of 91%.</p>

               <p>Although I didn't have any prior experience with coding, along with some friends I took part in Hack the North 2021++, where my team were one of the 23 winners of the hackathon out of 597 submissions. 
                We created mashme, a simple tool which uses intelligent processing
               to split songs into individual tracks (vocals, drums, guitar, etc.), and allows users to mash them together and create unique mixes.
             Check it out through the link to my Devpost at the bottom of this page!</p>
             <p>This was my first experience with coding, and I knew it wouldn't be my last. While working through my Mechanical Engineering degree, I explored coding 
              through online courses. When I completed my major, I decided to stay back and take a Computing Option, which I will be completing in April 2023.
            I am excited to further explore coding over the course of my career, and use my varied experiences to bring a unique perspective to projects.</p>

            <p>At Bombardier, I was brought in to re-imagine an inefficient section of a jet aircraft assembly line.
               Working with both the logistics teams and the people on the floor, I designed a streamlined storage,
               assembly, and testing process for the fairing panels of Bombardier private jets.
               To modernize the logistics department, I programmed a tool to track part shortages and alert users. 
               These initiatives resulted in tens of thousands of dollars saved in aircraft production costs.
               This is where I first experienced the intersection of engineering and coding, and it led me to where I am today.</p>

            <p>Did you know that car companies have their own detectives? When drivers report reocurring problems with their cars, it's up to a small squad
               of Quality Control Engineers to trace the problem back to a part, and find out when something went wrong between the time the car is designed
               and the time someone drives it home.
               As a QCE with Toyota, I investigated and resolved a problem with the front radar the Lexus RX350, which is resposible for sensing pedestrians and road traffic.
               This project was a great mix of problem-solving, data analysis, project management, and design.</p>
